GoldenGate -- Smarter Hall Passes
-
How it works:
- Student type in their school ID to GoldenGate
- GoldenGate checks out student and begins timer
- When student returns, they enter their school ID again and GoldenGate records the time they spent out of class
- Teacher and Admin can access a complete log of student times in View Logs
